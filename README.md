# travel-ahead

Instructions for running this project:

Once the repo is cloned, run this command:

`npm i` or `npm install` 

This will install all the dependencies for the project.

Next you will need to install expo, the program runner for our react-native project:

`npm install -g expo-cli`

This will allow you to use the `expo <command>` command in the command line / terminal.

To run the project:

`yarn start`

This will start the Metro Bundler. Now on your Android or iOS device, install Expo from the respective app store. 
In the Metro Bundler, use the tunnel option and you should be able to see it in the Projects tab on your phone. Once clicking
on the project, it should try and build the javascript bundle and you should see the current app!
